# otab
Tablature software (mainly targeting Ukulele but other instruments work too), currently only in terminal using curses

Use Python 3 on the otab.py file, make sure there's a directory called tabs right next to it. Included are three example files.

### Navigating
Up and down is scrolling, left and right select what part of the program you're controlling. + & - changes the size of the list on the left. Q is quit.

### Unstable
This program crashes when you resize the terminal, so be warned.
